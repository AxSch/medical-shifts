## Notes

### UI/UX Improvements

* Would create a navbar that displays the app logo & primary colour - flesh out a theme
* Would look to add skeletal loading for when the user is waiting for the data to load
* Would add functionality to filter out by roles or by specifying dates
* Search functionality to request results from a specific practice
* Add fuctionality to apply to the shift
* Add fuctionality to sort the shifts by metadata such as rate, date posted etcq

### Performance Improvements

* Would look at implementing some form of pagination
* Would look at using lazy loading & code splitting where needed, eg the ShiftList component
